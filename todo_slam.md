## Full SLAM Workflow — Stage-by-Stage Gap Analysis

A production SLAM pipeline is typically divided into the stages below. Each gap is rated by priority: **High** (blocks the pipeline), **Medium** (limits quality or generality), **Low** (nice-to-have).

---

### 1. Sensor Setup & Calibration

**Present:**
- Extrinsic calibration (sensor-to-ego and sensor-to-sensor transforms via `SensorCollection`)
- Intrinsic calibration model (pinhole + Brown–Conrady) for perspective cameras
- Example YAML rig definition with camera, LiDAR, radar, GPS, and IMU

**Gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Fisheye / omnidirectional camera model (Kannala–Brandt / equidistant) | High | ✅ Added `fisheye_focal_length_from_fov`, `fisheye_distort_point`, `fisheye_undistort_point`, `fisheye_project_point`, and `fisheye_unproject_pixel` to `camera_intrinsics.py`; supports FOV up to 360°. |
| Time-offset (temporal extrinsic) calibration between sensors | High | ✅ Added `time_offset_sec` field to `Sensor` and `time_offset_between()` to `SensorCollection`; `sync.py` applies the offset when aligning streams. |
| Camera-LiDAR target-based extrinsic calibration tooling | Medium | ✅ Added `docs/camera_lidar_extrinsic_calibration.md` with a full checkerboard/ArUco-target workflow for computing and saving the extrinsic transform. |
| IMU-to-vehicle extrinsic + bias/scale calibration | Medium | ✅ Added `ImuParameters` dataclass to `SensorCollection` with Allan-variance noise-density and random-walk fields, plus calibrated bias and scale-factor vectors. |
| Rolling-shutter model for cameras | Medium | ✅ Added `rolling_shutter_row_time`, `rolling_shutter_correct_point`, and `rolling_shutter_project_point` to `camera_intrinsics.py`; first-order constant-velocity correction with fixed-point iteration for row convergence. |

---

### 2. Sensor Data Acquisition & Synchronisation

**Present:**
- Binary and text parsers for all major sensor types
- Frame-duration concept in `FramePoseSequence`

**Gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Multi-sensor time synchronisation / interpolation | High | ✅ Added `sync.py` with `SensorSynchroniser` class and standalone `apply_time_offset`, `find_nearest_indices`, and `interpolate_timestamps` helpers; integrates with `Sensor.time_offset_sec`. |
| ROS launch/parameter files for cameras, GPS, IMU, and radar | High | ✅ Added ROS 1 launch files and ROS 2 parameter files for USB camera (`usb_cam`), NMEA GPS, MicroStrain IMU, and TI mmWave radar in `ros_examples/`. |
| GPS / GNSS ROS driver integration and RTK setup guide | High | `gps/nmea.py` parses log files but there is no live-driver config or RTK correction pipeline. Noted in `TODO.md`. |
| IMU ROS driver integration | Medium | ✅ Added `ros_examples/ros/microstrain_imu.launch` (ROS 1) and `ros_examples/ros2/microstrain_imu_params.yaml` (ROS 2) for the MicroStrain IMU driver. |
| Radar ROS driver integration | Medium | ✅ Added `ros_examples/ros/ti_mmwave_radar.launch` (ROS 1) and `ros_examples/ros2/ti_mmwave_radar_params.yaml` (ROS 2) for the TI mmWave radar driver. |
| Rosbag / MCAP recording and playback utilities | Medium | No tooling to record or replay multi-sensor data in a ROS-compatible bag format. |
| Data capture instructions and intrinsic calculation guide | Medium | ✅ Added data collection guides in `docs/` for cameras (pinhole: `camera_intrinsics_guide.md`; fisheye: `fisheye_camera_intrinsics_guide.md`), GPS (`gps_data_collection.md`), LiDAR (`lidar_data_collection.md`), and radar (`radar_data_collection.md`). |

---

### 3. Motion Estimation (Odometry Front-End)

**Present:**
- Trajectory storage structure (`FramePose`, `FramePoseSequence`)
- Coordinate-frame transforms for stitching sensor observations

**Gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| LiDAR odometry / scan matching (ICP, NDT, or LOAM-style) | High | ✅ Added `lidar/scan_matching.py` with point-to-point ICP (`icp_align`) using the Kabsch SVD algorithm and a scipy KD-tree for nearest-neighbour search; supports max-correspondence distance filtering, an optional initial transform, and convergence tolerance. |
| IMU pre-integration | High | ✅ Added `imu/preintegration.py` with `ImuPreintegrator` class; uses midpoint (trapezoidal) method to accumulate ΔR, Δv, Δp between keyframe timestamps. |
| Visual odometry (feature tracking / direct methods) | High | ✅ Added `visual_odometry.py` with `estimate_essential_matrix` (normalised 8-point algorithm + RANSAC), `recover_pose_from_essential` (SVD decomposition + cheirality test), and `solve_pnp` (DLT + RANSAC); pure NumPy/SciPy implementation. |
| Wheel odometry / vehicle kinematic model | Medium | No differential-drive or Ackermann model for dead-reckoning between frames. |
| GPS-to-local-frame converter (ECEF ↔ ENU / UTM) | Medium | ✅ Added `gps/converter.py` with `geodetic_to_ecef`, `ecef_to_geodetic`, `ecef_to_enu`, `enu_to_ecef`, `geodetic_to_enu`, `geodetic_to_utm`, and `utm_to_geodetic`. |

---

### 4. Loop Closure Detection

**Present:**
- Nothing directly applicable.

**Gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Place recognition / appearance-based descriptor (DBoW, NetVLAD, etc.) | High | ✅ Added `loop_closure.py` with `compute_scan_context` (Scan Context polar-grid descriptor), `scan_context_distance` (rotation-invariant normalised cosine distance with column-shift search), and `ScanContextDatabase` (two-stage ring-key pre-filter + full descriptor search with exclusion window). Pure NumPy/SciPy; no additional dependencies. |
| Geometry-based loop closure verification (ICP/NDT re-alignment) | High | ✅ Handled by the existing `lidar/scan_matching.py` `icp_align` function; after a loop candidate is found via `ScanContextDatabase.query`, callers pass the two point clouds to `icp_align` for geometric verification and edge estimation. |
| LiDAR descriptor matching (Scan Context, M2DP, etc.) | Medium | LiDAR-based place recognition can complement or replace visual bag-of-words approaches. |

---

### 5. State Estimation & Sensor Fusion

**Present:**
- Individual sensor parsers providing raw measurements.

**Gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Extended / Unscented Kalman Filter (EKF/UKF) for pose estimation | High | ✅ Added `imu/ekf.py` with `EkfState` and `ImuEkf`; implements a 15-state Error-State EKF with `predict` (IMU propagation), `position_update` (GPS/odometry), `velocity_update` (wheel odometry/GPS-Doppler), and `pose_update` (6-DOF LiDAR scan-matching); Joseph-form covariance update for numerical stability; pure NumPy. See `docs/state_estimation.md`. |
| IMU-LiDAR tightly/loosely coupled fusion | High | Needed to compensate for LiDAR motion distortion and produce continuous odometry at IMU rate. |
| GPS / GNSS absolute-position fusion | Medium | Ties the local map to a global coordinate frame; useful for multi-session SLAM. |
| Radar-odometry or radar-SLAM integration | Low | Radar can complement LiDAR in adverse weather; no fusion mechanism exists. |

---

### 6. Back-End Pose Graph Optimisation

**Present:**
- `FramePoseSequence` stores poses but applies no optimisation.

**Gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Pose graph construction (nodes = poses, edges = relative constraints) | High | No graph data structure or API for adding odometry and loop-closure edges. |
| Non-linear graph optimisation (g2o, GTSAM, Ceres, or iSAM2) | High | Essential for global consistency after loop closures are detected. |
| Marginalisation / sliding-window optimisation for online SLAM | Medium | Full batch optimisation becomes intractable on long trajectories; a sliding-window or fixed-lag smoother is needed. |
| Uncertainty / covariance propagation in `FramePose` | Medium | `FramePose` stores only the mean pose; no covariance matrix is tracked. |

---

### 7. Map Representation

**Present:**
- Nothing — the library is calibration/parsing focused and produces no persistent map.

**Gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Accumulated point-cloud / surfel map | High | A basic coloured point-cloud map assembled from successive LiDAR scans. |
| Occupancy grid (2-D or 3-D) | Medium | Required for path planning and obstacle avoidance. |
| Voxel map / TSDF (TSDFusion, VDB, etc.) | Medium | Memory-efficient volumetric representation used for dense reconstruction. |
| Map serialisation (PCD, PLY, or custom binary format) | Medium | No mechanism to save or load a built map. |
| Map management (submap division, keyframe selection) | Low | Needed for large-scale or long-duration sessions. |

---

### 8. Visualisation

**Present:**
- No visualisation tooling.

**Gaps:**

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Multi-sensor data viewer (point clouds, images, trajectory) | High | A viewer that can synchronise and display data from all sensors is noted in `TODO.md`. |
| Real-time trajectory and map visualisation (RViz, Open3D, rerun.io) | High | Essential for debugging odometry and loop closures. |
| LiDAR–camera overlay visualisation | Medium | `lidar_camera.py` projects points but there is no rendering or display utility. |
